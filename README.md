# Lindsbacka Ceramics

A presentation of Ulla Ceder's creations under the name Lindsbacka Ceramics. Essentially a platform to display her work, including contacts for purchase and visits. Also information on the courses that are being held throughout the year, and other creative projects that Ulla is part of.

## UX
------

### User Stories
I'm expecting users coming here for different reasons, but mostly either with interest in buying or learning more them selves. I categorize the users according to the following list.
- An everyday user with general interest in ceramics being curious.
- A user looking to visit and/or buy creations.
- Users wanting to learn how to do it them selves, looking for a course.
- Other artist users looking for inspiration or contact for collaboration.

### Design and Mockups
My mockups are made using [Figma](http://www.figma.com). For the colors I've used [Color Scheme Designer 3](https://http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) as my tool, and choices are based on the colors of pottery clay. Fonts used on the page are Cormorant, Pacifico and Roboto.  

You can see my mockups here, divided by device:

## Testing
Since this is a simple landing page, the site has gone through manual testing. And after that it has had the code validated.
### First Test - Manual testing in Chrome Dev Tools
Using Dev Tools, checking booth responsiveness, navigation and links. One screen size at a time.
- Mobile 
    - Design and responsiveness - Making sure everything looks the way it should. Since the site was made for mobile first, this one worked out really well from the start.
    - Links and Buttons - Making sure links and buttons take you where they should
    - Navigation - Testing the dropdown navigation, making sure it's visible and the navbar for larger screens is hidden
    - Tested the "Send"-button in the contact form making sure the Alert is displayed as it should
- Tablet (Normal and bigger)
    - Design and responsiveness - Making sure everything looks the way it should. Margins and the layout didn't respond in the dessired way in the beginning and the code had to be changed for a nicer look
    - Links and Buttons - Making sure links and buttons take you where they should
    - Navigation - Testing navigation, making sure it's visible and that the dropdown for mobile screens is not visible
    - Tested the "Send"-button in the contact form making sure the Alert is displayed as it should
- Desktop (Laptop and large screen resolution)
    - Design and responsiveness - Making sure everything looks the way it should. The index and contact page ended up not being good enough in the beginning and had to be adjusted
    - Links and Buttons - Making sure links and buttons take you where they should
    - Navigation - Testing navigation, making sure it's visible and that the dropdown for mobile screens is not visible
    - Tested the "Send"-button in the contact form making sure the Alert is displayed as it should

    - Pasted the url of each individual page for validation. A few minor errors in the code was discovered and corrected.
