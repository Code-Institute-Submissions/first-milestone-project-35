											<h4>
												Christmas Market and New Course Dates!
											</h4>

											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												It's been a busy few weeks lately, with the local Christmas market in
												Gnesta and a lot of other things going on. Being part of planing and
												organizing the whole thing sure is a lot of fun, but also very time
												consuming. 
                                                <br><br>
                                                We had a total of 16 members, me included, from the Gnesta Art Association 
                                                displaying and selling beautiful pieces. Everything from scultptures and 
                                                painting, to etchings and wood figurines. And then an additional 32 stands 
                                                with eveything you could think of. Candy, toys, clothes and everything you 
                                                would an wouldn't expect to find at a Christma market. We estimated the 
                                                amount of guests to around 7200 over the cours of the weekend, which is 
                                                almost double from last year. This thing is really taking off. And that 
                                                really feels great for us artists and like it's contributing to the whole 
                                                community. 
                                                <br><br>
                                                I feel like we've made a very inviting, warm and open platform 
                                                where both artists, creative minds and customers can meet, and  i hope 
                                                you'll also feel tempted to visit us next year. It's really worth the trip!

												Another thing that's been going on lately is that I've finally have been
												able to make a schedule for all the courses that will be held during the
												spring of 2020. I've recieved a lot of emails from interested people

												Pottery and Ceramics, Course for beginners - Learn the Basics
											</h5>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Per usual I'll be holding several classes for beginners where you
												get to learn the basics and lay the ground for a creative hobby with
												limits only set by your own time and imagination. The beginners
												course is split up to 5 different meetings with the 4 first of them
												being 5 hours each. Consisting of around 90 minutes of theory and
												information, and then followed by some hands on work. We'll go
												through all the basics and most of the common flaws and mistakes
												that a lot of people usually run into in their beginning of pottery
												making. After the fourth session all of the things we've made will
												be kilned to harden. And in the 5th session we'll meet up for 3
												hours, to talk about our finnished pieces, what we've learned, and
												where to go from here if you want to learn more. You'll see the
												dates further down in this post. Don't wait to long, classes usually
												fill up in 4-5 weeks. <br>
                                            </p>
											<h5>
												Pottery and Ceramics, Advanced course - Perfect your finishing
												touches and glazes.
											</h5>
											<p class="blog-paragraph">
												Once or twice during the year I'm also arranging an advanced
												class for people who've gone throug either my course for
												beginners or have a some experience from somewhere else. When it
												comes to working with clay, the shaping isn't something that you
												can learn fully theoreticly, you must also put in the hours of
												hands on work and learn by doing. There is of course always room
												for tips and improvements, and we'll cover some of that. But
												most of the focus is on the finishing touches, to make your
												piece stand out and look it's best. Covering different
												techniques of galzing, printing and carving before we put it in
												the kiln. And we'll also go over 2 different kinds of kilns
												that'll give you very different end results. This course is
												distributed over 4 meetings of 4 hours each. <br>
